# Decentralized-Storage-Using-Blockchain
      
    DSB(Decentralized-storage-using-Blockchain) is a decentralized storage system in which each and every node is complete and indepentent.
DSB has almost same architecture as Google File System(GFS). Only key difference between two is in DSB the master server(as in GFS) is replaced with blockchain.
    DBS can be used for decentralized storage system were the storage providers will get rewared with the amount of data stored on the basis of some cryptographic algorithms.It can be used in decentralized web.

Installation  process is as follows:-

1. Install all the modules given in package.json file.

2. Rebuild it ->npm rebuild.

3. There are two folders one for backend and another for frontend.Both works on different port number.To start frontend goto Decentralized.    folder and type "npm run dev".

4. Traverse into backennd folder and type "node server.js".

5. Do this for each and every node connected in a network.


Note:- Enter your own Seed Phrase and Infura link into the project.(@deploy.js, @web3.js, @Server.js).
This is an demo project for college purpose.


If you want to deploy your own contract :-

  1.Traverse into Ethereum folder.

2. Type "node compile.js".

3. "node deploy.js".

4. Replace the contract address.
